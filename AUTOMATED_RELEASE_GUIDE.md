# 🤖 Automated Release Process - Quick Reference

## Overview

The Intelligent Heating Pilot project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate release creation. You only need to prepare the documentation and push a tag - GitHub does the rest!

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Release Process

### 1️⃣ Prepare Release Documentation

#### A. Update CHANGELOG.md

```bash
# Move [Unreleased] content to versioned release
## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- New feature descriptions...

### Changed
- Modifications...

### Fixed
- Bug fixes with issue references...

# Add version comparison link at bottom
[0.4.0]: https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0
```

#### B. Create Release Notes File

**Filename**: `GITHUB_RELEASE_v0.4.0.md` (in project root)

**Template**: Use `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md` as starting point

**CRITICAL**: Reference issues using markdown links for auto-closure:
```markdown
✅ Good:  [#16](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/issues/16)
❌ Bad:   #16 (won't auto-close)
```

Example:
```markdown
# Release v0.4.0 - Feature Name

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Issue #16: Description
Fixed pre-heating revert logic ([#16](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/issues/16))
```

#### C. Update Version Numbers

Files to update:
- `custom_components/intelligent_heating_pilot/manifest.json` → `"version": "0.4.0"`
- `custom_components/intelligent_heating_pilot/const.py` → `VERSION = "0.4.0"`
- `hacs.json` → `"version": "0.4.0"` (if present)
- `README.md` → Update version badge

### 2️⃣ Merge and Tag

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on integration branch with latest changes
git checkout integration
git pull origin integration

# 2. Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge integration --no-ff -m "chore(release): merge for v0.4.0

Closes #16, #17, #19"

# 3. Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Release v0.4.0 - Brief Description

Key highlights:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Bug fix #16"

# 4. Push everything
git push origin main
git push origin v0.4.0
```

### 3️⃣ Wait for Automation (1-2 minutes)

**GitHub Actions will automatically**:

1. ✅ Detect tag push (`v0.4.0`)
2. ✅ Read `GITHUB_RELEASE_v0.4.0.md`
3. ✅ Extract issue numbers from `[#123](...)` links
4. ✅ Create GitHub Pre-Release:
   - Title: `v0.4.0 - Beta Release`
   - Body from your release notes
   - Append "Closes #X" for each issue
   - Mark as pre-release
5. ✅ Close all referenced issues
6. ✅ Add "released" label
7. ✅ Update project board

**Watch progress**: [Actions Tab](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/actions)

### 4️⃣ Verify and Publish

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/releases)
2. Review the auto-created release:
   - ✅ Title correct?
   - ✅ Body complete?
   - ✅ Issues closed?
   - ✅ Marked as pre-release?
3. If everything OK:
   - Keep as pre-release (for beta)
   - Or edit and uncheck "pre-release" (for stable)
4. Announce release (Community Forum, Discussions)

### 5️⃣ Post-Release Cleanup

```bash
# Reset CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section
## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

# Optionally delete release notes file
git rm GITHUB_RELEASE_v0.4.0.md
git commit -m "chore: cleanup release notes file after v0.4.0"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔧 GitHub Action Configuration

**File**: `.github/workflows/create-release.yml`

**Trigger**: Push to `v*.*.*` tags

**Permissions**:
- `contents: write` - Create releases
- `issues: write` - Close issues

**Key Steps**:
1. Checkout code with full history
2. Extract version from tag
3. Check if `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md` exists
4. Generate release body (from file or CHANGELOG)
5. Create GitHub Release as pre-release
6. Extract and close issues from markdown links
7. Update project board

**Fallback**: If release notes file missing, uses CHANGELOG.md

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub Action didn't trigger

**Check**:
1. Tag format correct? Must be `v1.2.3` (with `v` prefix)
2. Tag pushed to GitHub? `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
3. Workflow file exists? `.github/workflows/create-release.yml`
4. Check [Actions Tab](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/actions) for errors

**Fix**:
- Delete and recreate tag if format wrong
- Check workflow YAML syntax
- Verify repository permissions

### Issue: Release created but issues not closed

**Check**:
1. Issue references in `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md` use `[#123](URL)` format?
2. Issues are open (not already closed)?
3. GitHub token has `issues: write` permission?

**Fix**:
- Manually close issues: `gh issue close 123 --comment "Fixed in v0.4.0"`
- Update workflow to grant correct permissions

### Issue: Release notes incomplete

**Check**:
1. `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md` exists in project root?
2. Filename matches tag exactly? (case-sensitive)
3. File committed and pushed before creating tag?

**Fix**:
- Edit release manually on GitHub
- Or delete release, fix file, re-tag

### Issue: Want to create release manually

**Steps**:
1. Go to [New Release](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/releases/new)
2. Select tag: `vX.Y.Z`
3. Title: `vX.Y.Z - Description`
4. Copy content from `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md`
5. Append:
   ```markdown
   ---
   
   **Issues Fixed:**
   Closes #16
   Closes #17
   ```
6. ✅ Check "Set as a pre-release"
7. Publish

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

- **Test locally first**: Run tests, verify docs before tagging
- **Use descriptive titles**: `v0.4.0 - Multi-zone Support` not just `v0.4.0`
- **Reference issues properly**: Always use `[#123](URL)` format for auto-closure
- **Review before publishing**: GitHub Action creates draft-like pre-release first
- **Keep CHANGELOG current**: Update as you develop, not just at release
- **Version bump correctly**: Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

### ❌ Don'ts

- **Don't skip CHANGELOG**: Even if you have release notes, update CHANGELOG
- **Don't use plain #123**: Won't auto-close issues (use markdown links)
- **Don't forget version comparison links**: Add at bottom of CHANGELOG
- **Don't rush**: Double-check version numbers everywhere
- **Don't break SemVer**: Major.Minor.Patch has meaning
