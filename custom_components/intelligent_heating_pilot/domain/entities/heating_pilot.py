    This is the aggregate root that orchestrates all domain logic
    for intelligent heating control. It delegates decision-making to
    a configurable strategy, allowing users to choose between:
    
    - Simple rule-based decisions (no ML required)
    - ML-powered decisions (requires IHP-ML-Models add-on)
    
    This design follows the Strategy pattern, making the pilot
