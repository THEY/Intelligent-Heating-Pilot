## ✅ Documentation Standards

### Language
- **All documentation MUST be in English**
- Use clear, concise language
- Keep it short, every word must have its purpose: no repetition of other documents
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (then explain it)
- Use active voice when possible
- One documentation must adress one type of user (user, contributor, etc.)


### Formatting
- Use proper Markdown syntax
- Include code fences with language identifiers
- Use headings hierarchy correctly (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Add emoji for visual clarity (but don't overuse)
- Include tables for comparisons
- Use lists for sequential steps
- Include beautiful diagrams when helpful

### Structure
- Start with clear introduction
- Isolate important information in appendices at the end of the document **but** concerning specific points of interest to only a few readers;
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use descriptive section headers
- Add "Quick Start" when appropriate
- Include examples liberally
- Always indicate the latest version of the application which resulted in a modification of the documentation

### Links
- Use relative links for internal documentation
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Verify all links are valid
- Link to external resources when helpful

## 🔄 When to Update Documentation

### Code Changes
When code is modified, check if these docs need updates:
- [ ] README.md - If public API or usage changes
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md - If domain/infrastructure structure changes
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md - If development process changes
- [ ] Code examples in any documentation

### New Features
For each new feature, update:
- [ ] README.md - Add feature description and usage

```

## 🚀 Release Process (Automated)

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] All `[Unreleased]` changes documented in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Version numbers updated in:
  - [ ] `manifest.json`
  - [ ] `const.py`
  - [ ] `hacs.json`
- [ ] README.md reflects all changes
- [ ] Breaking changes clearly documented with migration guide
- [ ] All documentation links valid
- [ ] Code examples tested and working
- [ ] All issues mentioned in release notes use correct format: `[#123](...)`

### Creating Release Notes (Automated Workflow)

IHP uses **GitHub Actions** to automate release creation. The workflow is triggered when you push a version tag.

#### Step 1: Prepare Release Documentation

1. **Create Release Notes File**
   - Filename: `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md` (e.g., `GITHUB_RELEASE_v0.3.0.md`)
   - Location: Project root directory
   - Use `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
   
   ### Added
   - New features...
   
   ### Changed
   - Modifications...
   
   ### Fixed
   - Bug fixes...
   ```

3. **Add Version Comparison Link**
   ```markdown
   [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/compare/vX.Y.Z-1...vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. **Reference Issues in Release Notes**
   Use this format to ensure automatic issue closure:
   ```markdown
   - Fix for Issue [#16](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/issues/16)
   - Implements [#19](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/issues/19)
   ```

#### Step 2: Merge and Tag

Once documentation is ready:

```bash
# Merge integration branch to main
git checkout main
git merge integration --no-ff -m "chore(release): merge for vX.Y.Z

Closes #16, #17, #19"

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z - Brief description

Key highlights:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Bug fix for #16"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

#### Step 3: Automatic Release Creation

**GitHub Actions will automatically**:
1. ✅ Detect the version tag push
2. ✅ Read `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md`
3. ✅ Extract issue numbers from markdown links `[#123](...)`
4. ✅ Create GitHub Pre-Release with:
   - Release title: `vX.Y.Z - Beta Release`
   - Body from `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md`
   - Automatic "Closes #X" statements appended
   - Mark as pre-release (for beta versions)
5. ✅ Close referenced issues automatically
6. ✅ Add "released" label to closed issues
7. ✅ Update project board (move to "Done")

#### Step 4: Manual Verification

After automatic release:
- [ ] Review generated release on GitHub
- [ ] Verify all issues are closed correctly
- [ ] Check project board status
- [ ] If everything looks good, mark as published (or leave as pre-release)

#### Step 5: Post-Release Cleanup

1. **Update Unreleased Section**
   ```markdown
   ## [Unreleased]
   
   ### Added
   
   ### Changed
   
   ### Fixed
   ```

2. **Delete Release Notes File** (optional)
   ```bash
   git rm GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md
   ```

3. **Announce Release**
   - Home Assistant Community Forum
   - GitHub Discussions
   - Social media (if applicable)

### Workflow Configuration

The release automation is configured in `.github/workflows/create-release.yml`:

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Triggers on `v*.*.*` tags
- ✅ Reads from `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md`
- ✅ Extracts issues from markdown links
- ✅ Creates pre-release automatically
- ✅ Closes issues with release reference
- ✅ Updates project board

**Fallback Behavior:**
If `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md` doesn't exist, the workflow generates release notes from CHANGELOG.md.

### Manual Release Override

If you need to create a release manually (workflow failed or special case):

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/releases/new)
2. Select tag: `vX.Y.Z`
3. Title: `vX.Y.Z - Brief Description`
4. Copy content from `GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md`
5. Add at the end:
   ```markdown
   ---
   
   **Issues Fixed:**
   Closes #16
   Closes #17
   Closes #19
   ```
6. ✅ Check "Set as a pre-release" (for beta)
7. Click "Publish release"

### Release Checklist Summary

```bash
# Quick checklist for release preparation
✅ CHANGELOG.md updated with [X.Y.Z] section
✅ GITHUB_RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md created with complete notes
✅ All issue references use [#123](...) format
✅ Version numbers updated (manifest.json, const.py, hacs.json)
✅ README.md badge updated to vX.Y.Z
✅ All documentation links verified
✅ Code examples tested
✅ Commit, merge, tag, and push to trigger automation
```

## 🎨 Documentation Examples

### Good Example - Feature Documentation
```markdown
## 🌡️ Temperature Sensors

IHP uses multiple temperature sensors to make accurate predictions.

### Required Sensors

- **Indoor Temperature**: From your VTherm climate entity
  ```yaml
  climate.living_room
  ```

### Optional Sensors

- **Outdoor Temperature**: Improves accuracy in extreme weather
  ```yaml
  sensor.outdoor_temperature
  ```
  
- **Humidity**: Adjusts for moisture impact on heating
  ```yaml
  sensor.living_room_humidity
  ```

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
intelligent_heating_pilot:
  vtherm_entity: climate.living_room
  humidity_sensor: sensor.living_room_humidity
  outdoor_temp_sensor: sensor.outdoor_temperature
```
```

### Bad Example - Too Technical
```markdown
## Temperature Sensors

The `HAEnvironmentReader` adapter implements `IEnvironmentReader` interface to read sensor states from the Home Assistant state machine via the `hass.states.get()` API call which returns a `State` object containing attributes parsed by the `_parse_float()` helper method.
```
