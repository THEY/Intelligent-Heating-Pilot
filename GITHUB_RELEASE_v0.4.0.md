# Release v0.4.0 - Cycle-Based Learning & Docs Refresh

## ✨ Highlights
- Heating cycle extraction service and REST endpoint to build cycle histories for learning and debugging ([#44](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/issues/44), [#23](https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot/issues/23)).
- Learned Heating Slope now computed solely from detected heating cycles, using start/end temperatures and a delta threshold to ignore maintenance phases.
- Full user doc set added (Installation, Configuration, Troubleshooting, User Guide) plus clearer "How It Works" with updated LHS explanation.

## 🐛 Fixes & Hardening
- Broader unit and integration test coverage for adapters, decision strategies, and storage to stabilize data collection and calculations.
